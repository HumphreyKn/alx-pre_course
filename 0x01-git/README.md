# Do Hard Things- Fred Swaniker
It encourages us to push through the difficulties, keep pushing and maintain the motivation to achieve our goals. The main challenge is to keep going and we should not let the difficulties bring us down. We should stay strong, stay focused, and stay motivated when we face hard times.

My personal yet statement: Iâ€™m yet to be a great developer that will use my skills to solve many problems in this world. No matter the difficulties, I will keep pushing and maintain the motivation to achieve my goals.

One way I personally plan to practice growth mindset is by ensuring that I will always aim to find  a solution to any problem I come across at the course of my learning. I make sure that I have a significant improvement each and every day.
