# Do Hard Things- Fred Swaniker
It encourages us to push through the difficulties, keep pushing and maintain the motivation to achieve our goals. The main challenge is to keep going and we should not let the difficulties bring us down. We should stay strong, stay focused, and stay motivated when we face hard times.
